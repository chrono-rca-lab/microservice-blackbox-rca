"""Fault-chain integrated pinpointing algorithm (FChain Sections II-B/C).

Implements the full RCA pipeline described in the FChain paper:

  * Section II-B — per-service, per-metric abnormal change point selection:
      Layer 1  CUSUM + Bootstrap        change-point candidates
      Layer 2  Markov prediction model  prediction-error filtering
      Layer 3  FFT burst threshold      burst-aware abnormality filter
      Layer 4  Tangent rollback         onset-time refinement
      Layer 5  Multi-metric aggregation earliest onset across metrics

  * Section II-C — integrated fault diagnosis across services:
      Layer 6  Propagation chain        sort services by onset time
      Layer 7  Root cause candidates    earliest onset + concurrency check
      Layer 8  Dependency filter        remove spurious propagation paths

Typical usage from ``eval/run_experiment.py``::

    from rca_engine import fault_chain

    ranked = fault_chain.pinpoint(
        metric_matrix,
        baseline_window=(bl_start, bl_end),
        fault_window=(ft_start, ft_end),
        step_seconds=1.0,
    )

``ranked`` is a list of dicts ordered by FChain Section II-C ranking:
root causes first (earliest onset), then downstream propagation victims.
Each entry contains ``service``, ``onset_time``, ``confidence``,
``abnormal_metrics``, and ``rank``.

    """Run the full FChain RCA pipeline and return a ranked suspect list.

    For each service in *metric_matrix*, every metric is analysed through
    Layers 1-5 (Section II-B) to produce a rollback-refined onset timestamp.
    The per-service onset times are then passed to Layers 6-8 (Section II-C)
    which build the propagation chain, identify root causes, and filter out
    services whose abnormality is explained by downstream propagation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric_matrix :
        ``{service: {metric: np.ndarray}}`` covering the full time range
        ``[baseline_start, fault_end]`` sampled at *step_seconds* intervals.
        Arrays must be aligned: index 0 corresponds to *baseline_window[0]*.
    baseline_window :
        ``(start_posix, end_posix)`` of the clean baseline period used to
        learn normal behaviour for each metric.
    fault_window :
        ``(start_posix, end_posix)`` of the fault period to analyse.
        The look-back window for change-point detection is drawn from here.
    step_seconds :
        Prometheus scrape step in seconds.  Must match the resolution at
        which *metric_matrix* was built.  Default 1.0.
    propagation_map_path :
        Optional path to a ``calibration/propagation_delays.json`` file
        produced by ``calibration/calibrate.py``.  When supplied, Layer 7
        uses per-edge calibrated thresholds instead of the global 2.0 s
        constant.  If the file does not exist the parameter is silently
        ignored and the global threshold is used.
    start_time :
        POSIX timestamp when RCA pipeline started. If None, initialized to current time.
    logs :
        List to accumulate timing logs. If None, initialized to empty list.

    """Identify faulty services using the FChain Section II-C algorithm.

    Runs three sequential layers:

    Layer 6 — Build propagation chain
        Sort all abnormal services by their rollback-refined onset time.
        If every monitored service is abnormal and all share the same
        metric trend direction (all rising or all falling), the anomaly
        is attributed to an external cause (e.g. workload spike or shared
        infrastructure failure) and an empty list is returned — no
        individual service is pinpointed.

    Layer 7 — Identify root cause candidates
        The service with the earliest onset is the primary root cause.
        Any subsequent service whose onset falls within
        *concurrency_threshold_s* of the primary is treated as a
        concurrent independent fault and is also pinpointed.  The first
        service that started too late to be concurrent breaks the scan —
        all later services are assumed to be downstream victims.

    Layer 8 — Filter spurious propagation paths
        For every remaining abnormal service ``C``, check whether its
        abnormality can be explained by propagation from an already-
        pinpointed root cause ``R``.  Two propagation directions are
        considered:

        * Forward (``R → C``): the fault propagated downstream from R to C
          along a normal dependency edge.
        * Back-pressure (``C → R``): a faulty C caused its upstream
          caller R to stall, making R appear abnormal even though it is
          not the root cause.

        If neither path exists, C cannot be a propagation victim and must
        have an independent fault; it is added to the pinpointed list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    service_onsets :
        Rollback-refined onset timestamps (POSIX seconds) keyed by service.
        Only services that showed abnormal behaviour should be present.
    service_trends :
        Per-service overall metric trend direction: ``'up'``, ``'down'``,
        or ``'mixed'``.  Used for the external cause check in Layer 6.
    dependency_graph :
        Directed adjacency list ``{service: [services it calls]}``.
    n_monitored_services :
        Total number of services under observation in this experiment run.
        Pass ``0`` to skip the external cause check.
    concurrency_threshold_s :
        Fallback onset-time gap (seconds) used when no propagation map is
        available or an edge has no calibration data.  FChain default: 2.0.
    propagation_map :
        Optional per-edge delay map from ``calibration/propagation_map.py``.
        When provided, Layer 7 uses calibrated per-edge thresholds instead
        of the global *concurrency_threshold_s*.

        Semantics with a map:
          onset_diff <= edge_threshold  → within the propagation window
                                          → victim (not pinpointed here)
          onset_diff >  edge_threshold  → outside window, too slow for
                                          propagation → concurrent fault

        When the map is None the original FChain behaviour is preserved
        exactly (flat global threshold + early break).

    Returns
    -------
    list[str]
        Services identified as root causes, ordered by onset time.
        Returns ``[]`` if an external cause is detected or no services
